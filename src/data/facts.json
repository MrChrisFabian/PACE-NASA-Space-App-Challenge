    "title": "How does the ocean interact with light",
    "text": "Similar to the atmosphere, light attenuation in the ocean is dependent on the concentration of 'stuff' in the water. For example, light can shine all the water to the bottom of clear Caribbean waters, whereas you can barely see your hand beneath the surface in muddy river waters. Additionally, even in clear waters some wavelengths can penetrate further than others.",

    "text": "PACE's primary sensor, the Ocean Color Instrument (OCI), is a highly advanced optical spectrometer that will be used to measure properties of light over portions of the electromagnetic spectrum. It will enable continuous measurement of light at finer wavelength resolution than previous NASA satellite sensors, extending key system ocean color data records for climate studies. ",

    "text": "Just as bananas have spectral signatures, so do OACs in the ocean. The spectral signatures of each of these constituents - for example, chlorophyll, CDOM, sediment - tells scientists about their Inherent Optical Properties, information that is critical to deciphering which elements are being observed by PACE.",
