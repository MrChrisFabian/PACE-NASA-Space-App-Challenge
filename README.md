Weâ€™ve built an engaging web app that transforms NASAâ€™s groundbreaking PACE satellite mission into an interactive experience for everyone. Users can dive into its most thrilling discoveries through a sleek, vertical slide presentation, featuring vivid images, intriguing topics, and bite-sized explanations that ignite curiosity. Our web app also features "Planktyn," an AI-powered chatbot that guides users through PACE's most important findings. Planktyn allows users to ask questions, dive deeper into the data, view relevant images, access official NASA resources, and explore further learning opportunities. This approach is essential because it adapts to various learning environmentsâ€”whether itâ€™s a teacher using the platform to present the mission in a classroom or students engaging in self-learning. Planktyn is prepared to answer questions ranging from the simplest to the most complex, making it accessible for all. Additionally, users can not only explore the data but also learn about the instruments PACE uses to gather it.
